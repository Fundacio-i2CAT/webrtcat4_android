[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/seg-i2cat/WebRTCat/webrtcat4_android/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/seg-i2cat/WebRTCat/webrtcat4_android/_latestVersion)

This project contains the WebRTCat4 client application for Android as well as
a reusable Android module that can be included in other projects.

##### To use WebRTCat4 in your Android project:
- In your project's root directory, create a top-level directory called `libs` and copy the aar file generated by the webrtcat4 module (in `webrtcat4/build/outputs/aar`). Do **not** copy the JAR files in `webrtcat4/libs` (they are already included inside the `webrtcat4.aar` file)

- In your application's **build.gradle** file, add `webrtcat4.aar` as a dependency:

```
    dependencies {
        compile(name:'webrtcat4', ext:'aar')
        ...
    }
```

- Add `SurfaceViewRenderers` in the layout of the activity of the video call.

- Configure the WebRTCat object as seen in `WebRTCallActivity.java`

- In your application's `AndroidManifest.xml`, make sure the `CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` permission is included.

##### To make the sample app work:
- Create `sampleapp/assets/webrtcat.properties` using `sampleapp/assets/webrtcat.properties.sample` as base. Configure each property with proper URL.
